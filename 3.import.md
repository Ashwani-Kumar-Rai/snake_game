## IMPORT ?

\--When you write the code import pygame in a Python script, it instructs the Python interpreter to load the Pygame library and make its functions, classes, and other components available for use in the script.



## 

## HOW DOES IT MAKE AVAILABLE TO OUR CODE ?

\--When you import the pygame module in your script, the Python interpreter looks for the Pygame library files on your system and loads them into memory. This makes all of the functions, classes, constants, and other components defined in the library available for use in your script.




## LOOKS FOR THE PYTHON LIBRARY FIELS ON YOUR SYSTEM AND LOADS THEM INTO MEMORY ? (MEMORY-> RAM)

\-- When you import the pygame module in your script, the Python interpreter searches for the Pygame library files on your system. The search path includes directories specified in the __PYTHONPATH environment variable__, as well as other standard locations such as the system-wide Python installation directory.


\--Once the Python interpreter finds the Pygame library files, it loads them into memory. This means that the code in the Pygame library is read and compiled by the Python interpreter, and the resulting compiled code is stored in memory so that it can be executed when needed.


\--By loading the Pygame library into memory, all of its functions, classes, constants, and other components become available for use in your script.

\--This allows you to access and utilize the features and functionality provided by the library, such as creating windows, drawing graphics, playing sounds, and more.





## WHAT HAPPENS IF THE SIZE OF THE LIBRARY IS MORE THAN THE SIZE OF THE RAM ?

\--If the size of the library is larger than the available RAM on the system, the operating system will start paging parts of the library out to the swap space on disk.

\--This means that the least-used parts of the library will be temporarily stored on the hard drive, and only the most frequently accessed parts will be kept in RAM.
