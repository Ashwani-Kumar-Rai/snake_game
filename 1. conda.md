## **__WHAT IS CONDA ?__**

**__CONDA__** :

\-- is an open-source PACKAGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM and ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM .

\--it  allows users to create isolated environments that contain specific versions of packages

\--Conda also enables users to share and __reproduce their environments easily,__ making it an essential tool for __reproducible research.__


```
  conda create -n pygame_env python=3.7
```



## WHEN TO USE CONDA ?

```
--You are working on data science, scientific computing,
     or machine learning projects that require specific versions of Python or packages .

--You need to manage complex dependency requirements
--You want to create and manage isolated environments
```


## WHEN TO USE PIP ?

```
--You are working on general Python development purposes
--You need to install packages that are not available in Conda
--You want to install packages quickly without worrying about dependencies
```


## COMMAND ?

**conda create -n pygame_env python=3.7** 


\--conda create: This is the command to create a new Conda environment. 

\--   -n pygame_env: This option specifies the name of the new environment, which is pygame_env in this case. ----------python=3.7: This option tells Conda to install Python version 3.7 in the new environment.


\--After running this command, Conda will create a new environment called pygame_env with Python 3.7 installed in it.


\--conda activate pygame_env : You can activate this environment using this command

\--Once activated, any packages you install or updates you make will be specific to this environment only. 


\--This means that you can create different environments for different projects, each with their own set of packages and dependencies, without worrying about conflicts between them.
