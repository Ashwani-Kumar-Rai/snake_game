```python
from enum import Enum 
# from module import class  
```


## ENUM MODULE 

\-- In Python, `enum`  is a module that provides support for enumerations, 


\-- which are a way to define a __set of named values with a more expressive and readable syntax__ than using plain integers or strings.



## why not use plan enum without importing

* plain classes or constants to implement enums can lead to **__several drawbacks,__** including:

  \


1. **__Typing errors and inconsistencies,__** making it easy to pass the wrong value or compare two values that shouldn't be compared.

   \
2. **__More verbose and less readable__** code due to the need for more boilerplate code to define the values.

   \
3. **__Maintenance issues__** due to the difficulty of updating or modifying the enum, especially if it's used in many places throughout the codebase.
